                By day, I'm a product manager, 
                driving end-to-end product development. 
                I focus on deeply understanding user needs, 
                bridging design and engineering, and ensuring fast, 
                high-quality execution to build products customers love.

            On the side, I'm building apps and websites with AI and writing about
            the intersections of Christianity and technology. I'm endlessly
            curious about the world and the people in it, because I know we were placed
            in this moment in time for a reason.

            In my free time, you can find me spending time with my family,
                gathering eggs from my backyard chickens,
                listening to podcasts,
                meeting friends at a coffee shop (for the vibes, not the coffee),
                or playing a board game.
